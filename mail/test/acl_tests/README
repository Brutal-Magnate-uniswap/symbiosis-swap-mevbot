Format
======

 * The first line should be the IP that you want the connection to
   originate from.
 * Then any line that doesn't consist solely of three digits will be considered
   something to be passed as a command or data.
 * The file will be read and "exim4 -bh <ip address>"will be used to simulate an
   SMTP transaction, and the result of each command will be compared to the three
   digit code following the line.

Example
=======

A file containing:

---8<---------------------------------
127.0.0.1
EHLO localhost
250
MAIL FROM:<test@test.com>
250
RCPT TO:<test@test2.com>
250
DATA
330
Blah
Blah
Blah
.
350
QUIT
221
---8<---------------------------------

This will do the following:

 * Connect "from" 127.0.0.1
 * Wait for the first 220 (this is part of the test and is not configurable)
 * Issue "EHLO localhost"
 * Expect to get a 250 code back
 * Issue "MAIL FROM:<test@test.com>"
 * Expect to get a 250 code back
 * and so on.

Bugs
====

 * No STARTTLS support
 * Cannot test to see if the connection has been dropped.
