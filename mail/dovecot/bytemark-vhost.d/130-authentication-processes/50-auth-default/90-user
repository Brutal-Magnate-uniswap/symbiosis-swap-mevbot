  # User to use for the process. This user needs access to only user and
  # password databases, nothing else. Only shadow and pam authentication
  # requires roots, so use something else if possible. Note that passwd
  # authentication with BSDs internally accesses shadow files, which also
  # requires roots. Note that this user is NOT used to access mails.
  # That user is specified by userdb above.
