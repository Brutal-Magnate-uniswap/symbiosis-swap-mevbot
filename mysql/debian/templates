Template: symbiosis-mysql/admin_password
Type: password
Description: Enter a password for the 'admin@localhost' MySQL user:
 MariaDB enforces Unix socket authentication by default, which is incompatible with phpMyAdmin.
 A new MySQL user will be created, 'admin@localhost', which uses traditional username/password 
 authentication and is therefore compatible with phpMyAdmin. This user will have privileges
 equivalent to 'root@localhost'.
