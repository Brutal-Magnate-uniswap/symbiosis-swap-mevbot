  This package completely configures a Debian Etch machine for the
 virtual hosting of sites via FTP.

  To get started just create a new website beneath /srv/
  For example:

mkdir -p /srv/foo.com/htdocs
mkdir -p /srv/foo.com/cgi-bin

  Now save the ftp password away:

echo 'mysecretpassword' > /srv/foo.com/ftp-password
