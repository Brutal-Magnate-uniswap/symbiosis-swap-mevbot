Description: A simple firewall generator for the Bytemark vhost system
 This package contains a firewall generator which makes it simple to restrict
 the incoming and outgoing connections a machine is permitted to accept or
 initiate.

 The firewall also allows the user to restrict the abilities of the
 www-data user  which will ensure that any PHP, or website, compromises
 do not propogate.
