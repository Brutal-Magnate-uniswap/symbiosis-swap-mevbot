  This package contains a system to automatically generate valid TinyDNS
 files for the domains hosted upon the current host.

  The way this works is pretty simplistic by default each "host"
 (or directory beneath /srv) is assumed to point to the primary IP
 of the machine running the package.

  If the user wants to point the records at a new machine they should
 create the file:

        /srv/$hostname/config/ip

  This file will override the primary IP of the host machine, and ensure
 that all records point there.

 Bytemark Anti-spam service
 --------------------------

  At the moment this package will stick in appropriate snippets into
 /etc/exim4/bytemark-vhost.d for the exim config file to use. All these do is
 make sure that for domains configured to use the Bytemark anti-spam service,
 recipients are deferred unless the connecting machine is one of the anti-spam
 machines.

  To switch this on, touch

        /srv/$hostname/config/bytemark-antispam
