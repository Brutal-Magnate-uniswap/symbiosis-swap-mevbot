NAME

symbiosis-crontab - Execute an individual crontab

SYNOPSIS

  symbiosis-crontab [--help] [--test] [--no-mail-output] /path/to/crontab

DESCRIPTION

  This script is used for parsing and executing the per-domain
  crontabs that can be used in the Bytemark Symbiosis system.

  This script will only run when called as a normal user, i.e. with a
  user ID of greater than or equal to 1000.

OPTIONS

  --help  Show a brief help message

  --test  Do not execute the crontab, just show information about the
          environment and when the jobs will next run.

  --no-mail-output  Do not mail any output, even if a MAILTO
          environment variable is set

USAGE

  This script is called on a per crontab basis.  It can accept the
  formatting of a standard crontab(5) file.

  The environment variables PATH and MAILTO can be set.  PATH
  determines where symbiosis-crontab will look for its binaries.
  MAILTO determines where the output will be sent to.

  In the absence of a MAILTO, the output will get sent to the standard
  output.

  The --test option can be useful for determining when the commands
  will next get executed.

BUGS

  The @reboot shortcut is not understood.
