README
------

  This README is intentionally brief.  All the details on the Bytemark
 Virtual Hosting packages may be found online:

     http://vhost.bytemark.co.uk/

  Note that the repository has branches for etch + lenny.


Building The Packages
---------------------

  You should be able to build all packages via :

                make all

  Once you're done you'll see a bunch of .deb files in the current
 directory.  Failures are going to be hard to spot, so do look over
 the output to ensure that you see as many packages as you expect.

  (Mostly failures will be due to lack of build-dependencies.)




Releasing
---------

  To make a new release, visible on http://vhost.bytemark.co.uk/, you
 need to run:

        make sync-down

  Once you've done that you'll find a local tree:

   ./releases
   ./releases/live/
   ./releases/staging/

  Remove the obsolete packages and move your newly built ones into place.

  Now run

        make sync-up

  This will copy the files to /staging and /incoming on the vhost machine.
 This will place them correctly for releasing.

  Finally ssh to vhost and run:

        /home/www/vhost.bytemark.co.uk/htdocs/staging/build.sh

     or
        /home/www/vhost.bytemark.co.uk/htdocs/packages/build.sh
