README
------

  This README is intentionally brief.

  All the details on the Bytemark Symbiosis packages may be found online:

     http://symbiosis.bytemark.co.uk/

  Note that the repository has branches for etch + lenny.


Building The Packages
---------------------

  You should be able to build all packages via :

                rake all

  Once you're done you'll see a bunch of .deb files in the current
 directory.  Failures are going to be hard to spot, so do look over
 the output to ensure that you see as many packages as you expect.

  (Mostly failures will be due to lack of build-dependencies.)

Changing branches
-----------------

 This repo contains branches.

  * lenny
  * lenny-backports
  * default

 The default branch is currently tracking Debian squeeze.  To changes branches run

  hg update -C lenny

 and substitute lenny for the branch you want.
