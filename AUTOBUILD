Steps for Autobuilding and C-I
==============================

* Use old dedicated (AMD64) box as a autobuild host

* Post-commit hook to build packages on autobuild host
  --> email dev-list on error

* If the build succeeds,  create new dated repo with packages.
  --> Link /autobuild/current -> /autobuild/YYYYMMDD-HH:MM so that
  the most recent is available.
  --> Remove builds older than one month.

* Deploy a new VM on the machine, using the current Symbiosis image on the
  imager.

* Once installed, and upgraded to the current stable packages, run tests.
  --> email dev-list if these tests fail

* If tests pass, upgrade to newly built packages, run tests
  --> email dev-list if these tests fail

* If tests pass, remove machine.
