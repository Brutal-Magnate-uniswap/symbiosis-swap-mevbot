Steps for Autobuilding and C-I
==============================

* Use old dedicated box as a autobuild host
* Post-commit hook to build packages on autobuild host
  --> email dev-list on error
* If the build succeeds,  create new dated repo with both AMD64 & i386 packges.
* Deploy a new VM on the machine, using the current Symbiosis image on the
  imager.
* Once installed, and upgraded to the current stable packages, run tests.
  --> email dev-list if these tests fail
* If tests pass, upgrade to newly built packages, run tests
  --> email dev-list if these tests fail
