firewall
--------

1.  Fix www-data rule to work for lists of IPs.


features
--------

1. crontabs for each site.

2.  While we want stats to be enabled or disabled on a per-domain basis
   we want the default action, with no need for user-intervention, to be
   stat generation.
   On that basis we will always create stats, unless:
      a) The htdocs/ directory is empty.
      b) The file /srv/example.com/config/no-stats is present.

3. check for disk space and alert on low-usage.

4. Add munin?  Yann seems keen - I'm not sure it would be globally
   useful, but its nice to offer graphs to people regardless.

5. The ability to manage / add IPs in a non-root stylee.

6. Ensure each package is IPv6 compatible.

SSL
---

1. Fixup the SSL certificate for any additional IPs.
   (#227001 has the problem and a solution.)

2. Change create-ssl-sites to guess at key, crt, and combined SSL stuff, such
that the docs say "save the key as ssl.key, and the cert as ssl.crt", whilst
maintaining having a combined crt/key as ssl.key.

Email
-----

1. Make sure that exim4 forward-file errors get forwarded on
   somewhere sensible.

2. Enable Bytemark anti-spam service to be used (+dns changes?)
