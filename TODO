1.  Fix www-data rule to work for lists of IPs.


features
--------

1.  While we want stats to be enabled or disabled on a per-domain basis
   we want the default action, with no need for user-intervention, to be
   stat generation.
   On that basis we will always create stats, unless:
      a) The htdocs/ directory is empty.
      b) The file /srv/example.com/config/no-stats is present.

2. check for disk space and alert on low-usage.

3. The ability to manage / add IPs in a non-root stylee.

4. Ensure each package is IPv6 compatible.
