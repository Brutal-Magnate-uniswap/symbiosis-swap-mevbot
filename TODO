  1.  log to syslog when blocking IPs.

  2.  create $prefix/whitelist.d/ + $prefix/local.d/ at install-time.

  3.  firewall needs to be more uniform wrt the www-data rules.

  4.  Move the /usr/share/bytemark into a separate package so that it
     may be updated  without restarting apache.  (and so we can later move
     the documentation ito this package: bytemark-vhost-docs)

  5.  crontabs for each site.

  6.  per-vhost disable webstats flag.

  7.  check for disk space and alert on low-usage.

  8.  backup2l we should modify the umask, so that the backups aren't
     world-readable.

  9. backup2l we should try to guess the backup-space name if we can.

 10.  backup2l should use /etc/backup2l.dir/* and make a combined file
     via that.  Use a post-install to migrate to it easily enough.
