  1.  log to syslog when blocking IPs.

  2.  create $prefix/whitelist.d/ + $prefix/local.d/ at install-time.

  3.  firewall needs to be more uniform wrt the www-data rules.

  4.  Move the /usr/share/bytemark into a separate package so that it
     may be updated  without restarting apache.  (and so we can later move
     the documentation ito this package: bytemark-vhost-docs)

  5.  crontabs for each site.

  6.  per-vhost disable webstats flag.

  7.  check for disk space and alert on low-usage.

  8.  backup2l we should modify the umask, so that the backups aren't
      world-readable.

  9. backup2l we should try to guess the backup-space name if we can.

 10.  backup2l should use /etc/backup2l.dir/* and make a combined file
      via that.  Use a post-install to migrate to it easily enough.

  11.  Fixup the SSL certificate for any additional IPs.
       # 227001 has the problem and a solution.

  12.  The imager - CERT should be removed, and redone on post-install

  13.  Allow incoming.d/ & outgoing.d/ entries to be looked up by
     the name in /etc/services or to include port-numbers directly.
     For example:

        touch /etc/firewall/incoming.d/10-1234

      (Opens port 1234 for both TCP & UDP.)

  14. Add munin?  Yann seems keen - I'm not sure it would be globally
     useful, but its nice to offer graphs to people regardless.  So on that
     basis I'll say "yes">

  15. Make sure that exim4 forward-file errors get forwarded on
      somewhere sensible.

  16.  a) Add a randomised sleep to the DNS script to ensure that upload.ns
          isn't unduly hammered.
       b) Only upload if contents have actually changed.
