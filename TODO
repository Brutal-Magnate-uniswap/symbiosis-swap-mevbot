features
--------

1. crontabs for each site.

2. per-vhost disable webstats flag.

3. check for disk space and alert on low-usage.

4. Add munin?  Yann seems keen - I'm not sure it would be globally
   useful, but its nice to offer graphs to people regardless.



SSL
---

1. Fixup the SSL certificate for any additional IPs.
   (#227001 has the problem and a solution.)

2. The imager - CERT should be removed, and redone on post-install



Email
-----

1. Make sure that exim4 forward-file errors get forwarded on
   somewhere sensible.


Web
---

1. move the /usr/share/bytemark into a separate package so that it
   may be updated  without restarting apache.  (and so we can later move
   the documentation ito this package: bytemark-vhost-docs)
