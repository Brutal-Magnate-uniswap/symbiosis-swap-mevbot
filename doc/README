Symbiosis API Documentation
===========================

This package is generated from the comments in the Ruby code used
throughout the Symbiosis system.  It could allow users to develop
their own code based on the code written by Bytemark for the Symbiosis
system, allowing further developement to occur.

As ever, bugs or unexpectedness can be reported to the Symbiosis issue
tracker at https://projects.bytemark.co.uk/projects/symbiosis/issues.
