mod_vhost_bytemark
------------------

  This is a minimaly modified copy of mod_vhost_alias from the
 Apache 2.x source tree.

  There are only two minimal changes from the upstream version included
 in Debian:

  1.  The inclusion of the following patch:

     https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26052

  2.  Updated handling to make /srv/foo.com & /srv/www.foo.com synonyms.
