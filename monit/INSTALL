INSTALLATION

1) Copy ./lib to /usr/lib/ruby/1.8
2) Copy ./monit.d to somewhere sensible
3) Copy ./bin/bytemark-service-monitor to /usr/sbin
4) Add ./cron/bytemark-service-monitor to /etc/cron.d, making sure the sensible
   directory picked before is kept as the only argument to
   /usr/sbin/bytemark-service-monitor

TESTING

This can be tested in situ by running

  RUBYLIB=lib VERBOSE=1 ./bin/bytemark-service-monitor monit.d

Bear in mind that if you're not root, you'll get some odd errors.
